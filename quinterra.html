<h2>Quinterra</h2>
<p>
	We will not show you everything that is going on in <b>Quinterra</b> on this website, as that would just be too much to read here. Instead there will be downloadable .pdf files for you to find on the download page.
	<br/>
	Still, for new readers we wanted to give you a bit more than a few sentences to read into. So here you go!
	<br/>
</p>
<h3>A tour around the 5 planets</h3>
<p>
	Between its sun and Faum, the sixth and uninhabitated planet of Quinterra, there are the five brimming full of life.
</p>

<p>
	First comes <b>Tojiuma</b>, which turns around itself as fast as the sun, resulting in a deserted and devastated sunside and a nightside full of live, crime and the fight for order.
<br/>
	Holes in its outer shell lead to a smaller planet inside, called the core held in place by vast magnets which forbid almost all use of electricity on the planet.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Ifreet</b> is a planet covered with jungles, oceans and in them creatures of all varieties, while the relatively low gravity leads them to grow massively in size. There are furthermore the four moons of Ifreet, all with different attributes, bringing giant storms to crush and change the surface of the planet often.
	<br/>
</p>

<p>
	While it is still pretty hot on Ifreet, <b>Pan</b> is the planet with the most balanced temperatures and the biggest variety of species and cultures on it, which is why it was chosen to be a farm for the old empire, flooding Pan with machines that would gather food and take care of the planets ecosystem and also disrupt the rising cultures in their processes to stay weak.
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
	Just recently in the history of Quinterra did the alliance from Tojiuma reach Pan and brought change to the planet in technology and infrastructure, leading the way for others to explore Quinterra and arrive on Zplit’roq, a destroyed planet or rather field of asteroids circling around each other.
	<br/>
	<b>Zplit’roq</b> later became the base of the pirates, freedom movements, bountyhunters and a nest for the scum of Quinterra fighting for their supremacy.
	<br/>
</p>
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/myr_banners01.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Banners" /></span>
<p>
	Far away from temperatures that should allow live to exist is <b>Io</b>, almost completely out of ice is it the weakest in gravity but the planet that turns around the fastest, making a day last 5 earthen hours at most.
	<br/>
	The glaciers, deep water holes and snowstorms did their best to make the live on Io hard, but live could still grow unexpectedly.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<h3>The playable species in Quinterra</h3>
	We thought of 12 species which have their very own and unique abilities, bodystructure, behavioral and emotional patterns, sexualities and cultural backgrounds.

	Above are the <b>Arkyl</b> from the planet <b>Pan</b>, a proud species of small flying lizards. Evolutionary loners, they are able to defend themselves as they can mutate rapidly into giant, dangerous dragons of all kinds.
</p>
<p>
	Right next to them live the <b>Ledyil Faralorn</b> or short <b>Lefa</b>. Insectoid beings, adapting and therefore changing its bodies according to the area they are in. They grow in cocoons without family and die often after a short life of 15 years.
</p>
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/tobu01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
<p>
	As Lefa tend to not have a family, they are often taken in by <b>Tobu</b> into their loving communities.
