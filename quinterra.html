	<h2>Quinterra</h2>
	<p>
		We will not show you everything that is going on in <b>Quinterra</b> on this website, as that would just be too much to read here. Instead there will be downloadable .pdf files for you to find on the download page.
		<br/>
		Still, for new readers we wanted to give you a bit more than a few sentences to read into. So here you go!
		<br/>
	</p>
	<h3>A tour around the 5 planets</h3>
	<p>
		Between its sun and Faum, the sixth and uninhabitated planet of Quinterra, there are the five brimming full of life.
	</p>
	<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/tojiuma01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Tojiuma by Sören Meding" /></span>
	<p>
		First comes <b>Tojiuma</b>, which turns around itself as fast as the sun, resulting in a deserted and devastated sunside and a nightside full of live, crime and the fight for order.
	<br/>
		Holes in its outer shell lead to a smaller planet inside, called the core held in place by vast magnets which forbid almost all use of electricity on the planet.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Ifreet</b> is a planet covered with jungles, oceans and in them creatures of all varieties, while the relatively low gravity leads them to grow massively in size. There are furthermore the four moons of Ifreet, all with different attributes, bringing giant storms to crush and change the surface of the planet often.
		<br/>
	</p>
	<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pan01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Capital of Pan - Spirkay by Sören Meding" /></span>
	<p>
		While it is still pretty hot on Ifreet, <b>Pan</b> is the planet with the most balanced temperatures and the biggest variety of species and cultures on it, which is why it was chosen to be a farm for the old empire, flooding Pan with machines that would gather food and take care of the planets ecosystem and also disrupt the rising cultures in their processes to stay weak.
		<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Just recently in the history of Quinterra did the alliance from Tojiuma reach Pan and brought change to the planet in technology and infrastructure, leading the way for others to explore Quinterra and arrive on Zplit’roq, a destroyed planet or rather field of asteroids circling around each other.
		<br/>
		<b>Zplit’roq</b> later became the base of the pirates, freedom movements, bountyhunters and a nest for the scum of Quinterra fighting for their supremacy.
		<br/>
	</p>
	<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/myr_banners01.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Banners" /></span>
	<p>
		Far away from temperatures that should allow live to exist is <b>Io</b>, almost completely out of ice is it the weakest in gravity but the planet that turns around the fastest, making a day last 5 earthen hours at most.
		<br/>
		The glaciers, deep water holes and snowstorms did their best to make the live on Io hard, but live could still grow unexpectedly.

			<h3>The playable species in Quinterra</h3>
			We thought of 12 species which have their very own and unique abilities, bodystructure, behavioral and emotional patterns, sexualities and cultural backgrounds.

		<p>
			Above are the <b>Arkyl</b> from the planet <b>Pan</b>, a proud species of small flying lizards. Evolutionary loners, they are able to defend themselves as they can mutate rapidly into giant, dangerous dragons of all kinds and appearances. Some even becoming underwater beings for the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right next to them live the <b>Ledyil Faralorn</b> or short <b>Lefa</b>. Insectoid beings, adapting viciously fast to the area and circumstances they are or their parent was in. They grow in cocoons emerging from other Lefa and grow up without family other than the plant they parasite from. 
			<br/>
			While few devote their life to science, most go the way of live fast, die fast as their lifetime is 15 years in average.
		</p>
		<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/tobu01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
		<p>
			As Lefa tend to not have a family, they are often taken in by <b>Tobu</b> into their loving communities. Even though Tobu can look beastly dangerous with their four arms and muscular appearance and often are, they are also the most social of the species. It is bearable for only few Tobu to actually be alone for more than a while and there are even cases in which one died of solitude.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Their urge to be in a community also extended to animals and since then their whole being has adapted to this bond. Now, a young Tobu must connect with another being to survive its own unstable Astralwave (see Magic). They combine with their companion and can summon their ghost via their soul mask, mutating them temporarily.
			<br/>
		</p>
		<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/juzu01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
		<p>
			Only occasionaly found in the surroundings of other species are the <b>Juzu</b>, a hivemind from the south of the planet Pan, almost always connected to the network of their species, they stay united to realize their goals.
			<br/>
			Not just connected by thoughts but also emotionaly, they share the damage one takes but also can take more of it as it is shared.
		</p>
		<p>
			Originally from Ifreet, the <b>Axo'La'Quotl</b> or short <b>Axo</b> are one of the most complex species of Quinterra as they can transform into almost everything without losing their sense of being.
			<br/>
			By now you can find them almost everywhere in Quinterra, as their adaptation skills are even better then the ones of the Ledyil Faralorn.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next to the moving, slithering or flying Axo the <b>Banda Jit</b> seem sluggish, slow beings made of all kinds of unorganic materials. They basically are a mushroom (the Jit) which took the energy of an Elemental (see Magic) to build a consciousness.
			<br/>
			Mostly being quite peacefull and often not even acknowledgeable as they often look like heaps of rubble, many fear their hunger. As they get their consciousness through energy taken from dead beings, they fall into a mindless rampage to regain it if they ever fall below their limit.
		</p>
		<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/quirk01.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
		<p>
			Quite harmless looking, the <b>Quirk</b>, a species which comes from the same branch the Axo come from, are quite not. Ranging in size from 15 to 25 centimeters they are overseen by most predators and with their sucking tentacles which can hold them even when walking on most ceilings and walls they are quite mobile and stealthy.
			<br/>
			But what if they have to carry something really heavy? Then they summon their astralbodies, folding out their astralwave into a complete extension of themselves but multiple times bigger.
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other side of the spectrum there is the biggest (playable) species of Quinterra: The <b>Øjtûn</b> from Io.
