					            	<h3>Travel to a new Solar System</h3>
					            	<p>
					            	 	Our first solar system's name is Quinterra, it's name derived from the five inhabited planets cycling its sun. 
					            	 	<br/>
					            	 	In it, beings use the six waves the world is made of to weave their magic, manipulating matter, force, space and time, chaos and astral to do their bidding with the cost of their own lifeforce.
					            		<br/>
					            	 	Meanwhile others are driven by the ever advancing technology backed by past achievements of a gone Empire.
					            	 	<br/>
					            		<br/>
					            		The strong civilizations are young in Quinterra, just recently reaching for power in a world of spiking differences and with living gods - the Jayo - to entertain.
					            		<br/>
					            		<br/>
					            	</p>
					         	</p>

					         		<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/tojiuma01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Tojiuma by SÃ¶ren Meding" /></span>
					         		<h3>5 Planets - Tojiuma to Io</h3>
					         		<p>
						         		Long journeys through enormous deserts, barfights in a castle or space fights, between the planets of Quinterra is always something going on.
						         		<br/>
						         		Searching for bizarr beings? Need something from a moon in midst of a asteroid belt? Or would you rather dive deep down beyond the ice layers of the coldest of the planets?
						         		<br/>
						         		We gotcha.
						         	</p>
					            <p>
					            	<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/tobu01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
					            	<h3>12 Species - Of Arkyl and Kix</h3>
					            	Well, if there are bizarr beings, why not be one yourself as well? Myrmagir does not feature any humans from the get go.
					            	<br/>
					            	Of course you are invited to bring them in but wouldn't it be rather interesting to be able to see through 5 eyes for once?
					            	<br/>
					            	<br/>
					            	<br/>
