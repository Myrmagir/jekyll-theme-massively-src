<h2>Myrmagir</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		On this page we want to get into the depths of our development and ideas.
	</p> 
	<p>
		A sun, five planets, a myriad of cultures and twelve species together create the solar system Quinterra. Lots to explore and to talk about. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But first,</b> lets dive deeper into what Myrmagir is about.

		What we wanted was to create a world in which all genres could find their place, species really are different from us human beings and each detail has something new and exciting for explorers to experience. All of this, we decided, was to be in a easily extendable but foremost easily playable gamesystem with emphasis on the decisions of the game master. So we designed and still design it to not be table-heavy with whole books to learn by heart but found a pleasant median - at least we hope so.  
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p>
		The game is still and will be for a long time in development, therefore feedback is very much appreciated. We are playing the game already and there are almost always new questions to work on. So do not be shy to ask us some more.

	<h3> Goals and Compromises </h3>
	<p>
		<h2>Genres</h2>
		While working on Quinterra we realized that bringing sci-fi, fantasy and the modern age together created problems. Well obviously, it kind of strikes one when hearing of vicious clans with axes and swords and spaceshuttle using pirates with lasercanons that the clans might have the shorter end. So why do they even exist?
	</p>
	<p>
		Our solution to these problems is a very complex and abstract history of Quinterra with lots of compromises we are fighting on several ends. Obviously our historics will never be as worked out as the earths and some of you might always find details not matching or not working out for you. So lets make a deal: Tell us about them, but rather than compromising them into nothingness,  try to enjoy the variety! 
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Physics and Magic</h2>
		As much as we like the physics of our real world, we strive to extend it with out wavesystem and magic but will not be able to reinforce all the changes with plausible theories. Therefore we might change obvious facts of our real world in Quinterra without a coherent theory. We will though always try to find and improve the system.
